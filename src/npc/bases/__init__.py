"""
src.npc.bases
The bases submodule of npc contains all base classes for AI-controlled
Entities.

These classes should be used when needing to reference any specific entity
type, to avoid having problems with circular imports.

These classes are not intended to be initialised directly and should
generally only be inherited by entities of the respective type.
